  description: |
    Zipkin's Query api is rooted at `api/v1`, on a host that by default listens
    on port 9411. It primarily serves the zipkin-ui, although it includes a POST
    endpoint that can receive spans.

  /traces:

      description: |
          Invoking this request retrieves traces matching the below filters.

          Results should be filtered against endTs, subject to limit and
          lookback. For example, if endTs is 10:20 today, limit is 10, and
          lookback is 7 days, traces returned should be those nearest to 10:20
          today, not 10:20 a week ago.

          Time units of endTs and lookback are milliseconds as opposed to
          microseconds, the grain of Span.timestamp. Milliseconds is a more
          familiar and supported granularity for query, index and windowing

             Ex. `http.uri=/foo and retried` - If key/value (has an `=`),
             constrains against Span.binaryAnnotations of time string. If just
             a word, constrains against Span.annotations. Any values are AND
             against eachother. This means a span in the trace must match all of
             these.

          description: |
            Only return traces whose Span.duration is less than or equal to

          Note this flag has no value. Ex. /trace/{traceId}?raw

          Normally, the trace endpoint cleans trace data. For example, it merges
          spans by id, adds missing timestamp or duration, corrects clock skew..

          Specifying this flag is a debug case, when you are debugging zipkin
          logic or zipkin instrumentation, and want to see the input to these
          adjusters. For example, this might explain or rule out clock skew.
